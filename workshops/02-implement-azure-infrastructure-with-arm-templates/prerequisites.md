# Prerequisites

## Complete all labs from workshop #1

If you didn't attend previous workshop, I recommend you to complete all labs from [workshop #1](../01-how-to-live-in-harmony-with-ARM-templates/agenda.md). This is important because we will use a lot of techniques introduced during that workshop, so, please invest some time (you need approx. 4-5 hours) and work with [labs](../01-how-to-live-in-harmony-with-ARM-templates/agenda.md).

## Laptop

Of course you need an laptop. OS installed at this laptop doesn't really matter. The tools we will use work cross platform. I will be using Windows 10 with ubuntu (WSL) as a shell.

## Microsoft Teams

Download and install [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-US/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software)

## Visual Studio Code

Please download and install VS Code. It's available for all platforms.

## Create a new Project at Azure DevOps

Follow this [how-to guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page) and create a new project called `iac-ws-2`. Feel free to use existing project, if you already have one.

## Create a new git repository

Create new git repository under your Azure DevOps project. Follow this [how-to guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/create-new-repo?toc=%2Fazure%2Fdevops%2Forganizations%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fdevops%2Forganizations%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&view=azure-devops) and create a new repository called `immutable-infra`.

## Check that you have access to Azure DevOps

Try to login to your Azure DevOps Account. Use some time and get yourself familiar with this product. During the workshop we will use the following features of this product:

* [Repos](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/devops/repos/get-started/what-is-repos?view=azure-devops) - here we will keep our source code
* [Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops) - all our build and release pipelines will be implemented here

## Clone your newly created repository to your laptop

Clone your repository to your PC. Make sure that your git environment is initialized and you can pull and push code from / to you repository. Add readme.md file, commit changes and push them to the remote.

## Learn git

If you have never worked with git, learn the git [commands basics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html). You should be comfortable to clone, pull, commit and push your changes.

## Install `az cli`

Download and install latest version of `az cli` from this link  
[Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

## Install `az front-door` extension

```bash
az extension add -n front-door
```

Check that it was installed

```bash
az network front-door --help
```

## Install `az devops` extension (optional)

```bash
az extension add -n azure-devops
```

Check that it was successfully installed

```bash
az devops --help
```

## Test your azure account with `az cli`

Open your terminal (bash, cmd or powershell) and login to your azure account by running this command

```bash
az login
```

You will be redirected to the browser where you will need to login with your azure account. Sometimes, you need to manually copy code and enter it at this page [https://microsoft.com/devicelogin](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin). Just follow the instructions.

```bash
$ az login
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code DMBKTZBJL to authenticate.
```

Next (and this step is optional), you need to set your active subscription.
To get list of available subscriptions, use this command

```bash
az account list -o table
```

Note, The `-o table` or `--output table` parameter switches the output to a more concise human-readable format.

To set subscription use this command. You can use both subscription id or subscription name as value for `--subscription` argument.

```bash
az account set --subscription  xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

or

```bash
az account set --subscription subscription_name
```
